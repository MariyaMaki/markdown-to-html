<h4>You can always count on me whenever you need someone to hear you out.</h4>
I will bring my energy and empathy! ðŸ˜˜
<h5>A funny story</h5>
I injured my ankle on a mountain, had to go all the way down alone, met a dead foal (he was eaten by something) and when I arrived down the guides told me there was a bear up there and they didn't tell before so we can have a nice stroll...
<h6>TL;DR</h6>
Guides want people dead!ðŸ¤£
